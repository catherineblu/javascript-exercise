      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        A gemstone (also called a gem, fine gem, jewel, precious stone, or
        semi-precious stone) is a piece of mineral crystal which, in cut and
        polished form, is used to make jewelry or other adornments. However,
        certain rocks (such as lapis lazuli and opal) and occasionally organic
        materials that are not minerals (such as amber, jet, and pearl) are also
        used for jewelry and are therefore often considered to be gemstones as
        well. Most gemstones are hard, but some soft minerals are used in
        jewelry because of their luster or other physical properties that have
        aesthetic value. Rarity is another characteristic that lends value to a
        gemstone.

        Apart from jewelry, from earliest antiquity engraved gems and hardstone
        carvings, such as cups, were major luxury art forms. A gem maker is
        called a lapidary or gemcutter; a diamond cutter is called a
        diamantaire.
